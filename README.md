Alice likes playing letter cubes. Now, she is playing the following game: she constructs a word from her cubes and tries to understand how many different subwords the current word contains. Get tired after a lot of manual calculations, Alice decides to write a program that can calculate such subwords automatically. She knows that the prefix function might be useful here but hasn't figured out yet how exactly. Help Alice to answer her question and write a program that calculates the number of distinct subwords in a word using the prefix function.

Input: the first line contains a string ss.

Output: one integer â€” the number of distinct substrings contained in ss.

Keep in mind that the empty string is a substring of any string.
